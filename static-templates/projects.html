        Handpicked open source projects I've worked on.
        For a full list, see [my github repositories](https://github.com/daboross?tab=repositories&type=source).

        For reference, I've built projects related to the following games:

        - [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) is an online open-world game. All players upload AI to control their own empires, and the code on-server is run 24/7.
        - [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) is a popular first-person exploration / building game

        ### cargo-screeps, screeps-game-api

        Timeline: 2017 - today<br/>
        Language: Rust

        [cargo-screeps](https://github.com/rustyscreeps/cargo-screeps/) is a tool for compiling and uploading Rust AIs to Screeps servers. It supports both private servers, and the official server.

        [screeps-game-api](https://github.com/rustyscreeps/cargo-screeps/) contains API bindings to Screeps' unit control API for use by Rust programs compiling to web assembly.

        Together, these projects allow writing Screeps AIs in Rust. I wrote most of the initial code, and worked half-and-ahlf with co-contributors finishing up the rest of the API.

        ### screeps-api

        Timeline: 2017 - 2019<br/>
        Langauge: Rust

        [rust-screeps-api](https://github.com/daboross/rust-screeps-api) contains bindings
        to Screep's REST web API. The advantage over raw HTTPS calls is that all messages are
        typechecked, and all responses automatically parsed into structs.

        This allows you to work with the screeps web API as if it were just another Rust library,
        with full IDE auto-complete support and compile-time typechecking.

        ### scrs

        Timeline: 2017 - 2018<br/>
        Langauge: Rust

        [scrs](https://github.com/daboross/screeps-rs) is a full alternative Screeps client which can watch live map data.
        When written, it supported both the official server, and private servers (the official server has since changed protocol,
        and is no longer supported).

        scrs's advantage is that it runs as a small desktop GUI application, and consumes much
        less power than the official client. The disadvantage is that neither code-editing nor
        unit-level-detail viewing are supported.

        ### srv

        Timeline: 2019<br/>
        Langauge: Rust

        [srv](https://github.com/daboross/srv) is a full alternative Screeps client, the spiritual successor to scrs. Supports both private and official servers.

        While scrs was a desktop application, srv is written as a terminal user-interface. It implements all detailed viewing
        functionality present in the official client for only a fraction of the computing power. The other big advantage is
        getting those sweet ASCII graphics.

        ### fern

        Timeline: 2014 - effectively, 2019<br/>
        Language: Rust

        [fern](https://github.com/daboross/fern) is a logging library backend favoring runtime configurability and fast logging-path execution. Notably, it can run full formatting and filtering with zero allocations on the logging path.

        The sell is simple configuration. Since it's all Rust code, changing logging based on
        command line parameters or config files is easy. The biggest downside, compared to projects
        like [log4rs](https://github.com/sfackler/log4rs), is that that configuration still all has
        to be written in Rust code.

        ### qx.lc

        Timeline: 2014<br/>
        Language: Python

        [qxlc](https://github.com/daboross/qxlc) is a pastebin and link-shortening server.

        I wrote this as a learning experience for using the
        [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) web framework.

        ### SkyWars

        Timeline: 2013 - 2016<br/>
        Language: Java

        [SkyWars](https://github.com/SkyWars/SkyWars) is a Minecraft server plugin for managing
        ``SkyWars'' games. It queues players, creates arenas and overall manages players playing
        in competitions.

        ### FRC Team

        Timeline: 2012 - 2015<br/>
        Language: Java

        I was a programmer for the FRC team 4030 from 2012-2015. Notable contrbutions include:
        - writing the manual control code each year, translating joysticks into movement
        - writing autonomous code, where the robot will perform actions on its own
        - co-developing an independent control panel which networks with the robot, retrieves status information, and updates configurations.

        For background, FRC is a high school robotics competition. On one day in January, a theme
        and ruleset is released to teams across the world. Teams then have six weeks to build,
        test, and program the robot. On the sixth week, we box up the robot, and only unbox it for
        competitions.

        ### mc-cli

        Timeline: 2013 - 2014<br/>
        Language: Java

        [mc-cli](https://github.com/daboross/minecraft-commandline-interface) is a command line
        client for Minecraft. Uses [MCProtocolLib](https://github.com/Steveice10/MCProtocolLib)
        for connecting to Minecraft servers and [JLine](https://github.com/jline) for the
        interface. Lets you run 10+ fake clients connecting to the same Minecraft server.

        This is extremely useful for testing multiplayer plugin features when developing server-side plugins.

        ### MCScript

        Timeline: 2013 - 2014<br/>
        Language: Bash

        [MCScript](https://github.com/daboross/MCScript) is a bash script compiled for managing
        a local minecraft server on a linux. It handles backups, restarts the server regularly,
        ensures it stays running in the background and updates plugins.

        This is an alternative to web-based control panels, or just running the server manually. The
        main advantage is that MCScript "just works" after initial configuration.
