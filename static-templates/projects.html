        ### qx.lc
        An open source pastebin and short-link server. This was mostly a learning project for me, but it
        is also continually run at http://qx.lc, so check it out! The server was built in Python, using the Flask web
        framework.

        ### fern-rs
        A simple logging backend module for the [`rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language. This allows sending
        logging messages to multiple log backends as well as filtering each backend based off of message priority.

        ### SkyWars
        A server-side Minecraft Minigame where players fight to the death on floating islands. I built it
        when I was much more part of the Minecraft community, and I've continued add small updates and maintain it
        since. It is my most used open source Bukkit plugin, with over 400,000 downloads to date.

        - July 2013 - July 2016

        ### `mc-cli`
        `mc-cli` is a command line client for Minecraft. It uses an
        [open source library](https://github.com/Steveice10/MCProtocolLib) for connecting to Minecraft
        servers and [JLine](https://github.com/jline) for making a nice interface. It allows for 10+ fake clients to
        connect to the same running server, and is useful for testing plugin features which require many players to
        be online to function.
