        Here are some handpicked open source projects I've worked on. For a full list, see https://github.com/daboross.

        ### screeps-rs

        Alternative game client to the official Screeps client. Screeps is an online RTS-MMO where users upload JavaScript programs to control online empires.

        `screeps-rs` attempts to be an alternative to the official client. While the official client is run in the
        browser, `screeps-rs` runs natively. It does not attempt to be fully-featured, but rather a minimal alternative
        for those wanting a lighter client.

        ### fern

        Simple, efficient logging for the [`rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language. Lets users configure logging through branches/sub-loggers, up to an infinite depth. Each level can perform formatting, or filter through message priority or other arbitrary criteria.

        ### qx.lc
        An open source pastebin and short-link server. Mostly a learning
         project for python web servers, but also continuously runs at
        http://qx.lc. Built in Python with the flask web framework.

        ### SkyWars

        A server-side Minecraft Minigame where players fight to the death on
        floating islands. It was built when I was much more part of the
        Minecraft community, and I've been able to partially maintain it
        since. It is my most used Minecraft plugin, with over 400,000 downloads
        to date.

        ### `mc-cli`

        `mc-cli` is a command line client for Minecraft. It uses an
        [open source library](https://github.com/Steveice10/MCProtocolLib)
        for connecting to Minecraft servers and
        [JLine](https://github.com/jline) for making a nice interface. It
        allows for 10+ fake clients to connect to the same running server,
        and is useful for testing plugin features which require many players
        to be online to function.

        ### MCScript

        This is a bash script compiled for managing a local minecraft server on
        a linux server of VPS. It can handle backups, restarting the server
        regularly, keeping it running in the background and updating plugins
        with the right configuration.

        It mostly "just works" - not many changes are needed after initial creation.

        ### FRC Team
