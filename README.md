dabo.guru
=========

This is my personal website, https://dabo.guru. This app is a flask app, with static content generated by Frozen-Flask.

On https://dabo.guru, the frozen content generated by `build.py` is hosted by nginx. The dynamic content, this app, is
run on uwsgi, and is proxied through by nginx whenever a file isn't found in the static folder.

The static content found in the `static/` folder after running `build.py` is also copied over and run at
http://daboross.net, which is a copy of https://dabo.guru hosted by github pages.
