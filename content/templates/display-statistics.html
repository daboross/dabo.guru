        ### {{ plugin }} Statistics

        This is mostly a stand-in interface to view data while the actual one is being built. All data
        which is permanently stored about the plugin {{ plugin }} is available here, but it isn't in the
        nicest format.

        This page contains a list of records for {{ plugin }}.

        Records aren't directly the data reported by minecraft servers, but rather an aggregation of
        all live-reported data received up to two hours before the record.

        Records are made every hour, on the hour, and when each record is made all live-reported data
        older than two hours expires and is deleted.

        {% for record in records %}
            ---

            Record #{{ record["number"] }}: {{ record["date"] }}

            {{ record["total_servers"] }} servers, with {{ record["total_players"] }} online players.

            Version specific information:
            {% for version in record["plugin_versions"] %}

                Version {{ version["version"] }}: {{ version["server_count"] }} servers

                Server Version Statistics:
                {% for server_version, server_count in version["server_version_counts"].items() %}

                    {{ server_version }}: {{ server_count }}
                {% endfor %}
            {% endfor %}
        {% endfor %}
    {% endfilter %}
{% endblock %}
