This is my experimental/functional web server written in Rust using [actix-web].

Some code here might be good! Some will be bad. Much of it will be redundant with existing libraries since I'm using it to learn the actix and actix-web frameworks rather than being functional.

Much of the code will also likely be inefficient.
