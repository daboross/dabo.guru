Submitting a ticket
===================

## Feature requests

A few guidelines:

* Include a detailed description of the feature requested.
* Include why the feature would be a good thing to have.
* Do **not** group multiple feature requests together.
  If you have two ideas, make two tickets. Don't put them both into one.


## Bug report guidelines

* Include your server version and your SkyWars version. Version numbers, never say 'latest'.
* Include a detailed description of what is happening.
  Search your server.log file for errors, and include those.
* For everything you take out of the server.log file, please put it into a [gist](http://gist.github.com) and copy the
  link here. Also include 10 lines above and below the error/output you are capturing.
* Include the output of the **/sw report** comman in the ticket. This gives information on your configuration.
  If you are using version 1.3.2 or below, please use **/sw cfgdebug -p** instead of **/sw report**.
